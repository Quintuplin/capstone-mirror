splitting is unneccessary but can easily be done manually

this is because the app.R will have references to ui.r and server.r, 
and call them in order to make the summarized webpage

however, those are equally able to be in seperate files/directories as they are to be in the self-same file

to summarize
    seperating server and UI allows for
        1. allowing ui or server code to be easily shared between different 'apps'
        2. making logically distinct entities have their own files for better organization

    however, it comes at the cost of
        1. in case of different 'apps' requiring distinct ui or server functionalities, the number of 
            bloated files (either in file number or in file contents) goes up exponentially
        2. multiple files can unneccessarily split up logically associated functions
