# capstone-2019-nist

## The team: 
* Dylan Cowden
* Misae Evans
* Jack Fraser

## Explanation of Files not in this Repository: 
I have files for the raw, hela splib, fasta, and a converted mzML file; these are not github but if any teammates require the file, I can USB it to them.

## Explanation of Files in this Repository:

Rshiny folder; deprecated code from Rshiny implementation

dash folder; subfolders with each feature that I am working on. Ones with screenshots are functional, ones with out are still WIP. 

## Other notes:
If it has a screenshot but does not work on your machine, please contact me; you might have a setup issue that I would be happy to aid with, or I might be in the process of updating it (I occasionally push commits while working; all code is backed up here independent of completion.)
