# capstone-2019-nist

## The team: 
* Dylan Cowden
* Misae Evans
* Jack Fraser

## Explanation of Files not in this Repository: 
I have files for the raw, hela splib, fasta, and a converted mzML file; these are not github but if any teammates require the file, I can USB it to them.

## Explanation of Files in this Repository:

APP folder(s); most completed and combined capability apps that satisfy project requirements per project_layout.jpg

dash subfeatures folder; subfolders with subfeatures. This is largely a WIP and experimental section, with screenshots added to subfeatures as they are made functional. Each subfeature is intended to be brought in to one of the APPs eventually

Rshiny oldcode folder; deprecated code from Rshiny implementation, kept for posterity

## Other notes:
If it has a screenshot but does not work on your machine, please contact me; you might have a setup issue that I would be happy to aid with, or I might be in the process of updating it (I occasionally push commits while working; all code is backed up here independent of completion.)
