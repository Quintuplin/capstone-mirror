msconvert works!

however, some changes will be needed when run on a machine other than my own
the two primary changes are that the location of msconvert.exe will vary per machine, and the location which you save to will also vary per preference

another noteworthy detail is that msconver takes a loooong while
you can ensure that it is working by looing at the debug output in your terminal; msconvert has a number of outputs to signify that it is functioning correctly, and the largest time sink is "writing output file"
please be patient, and enjoy a functioning converter!

it should probably also have a message along the lines of "calculations may take some time: please check back in 15 minutes. the webpage is safe to close, but please remember your URL. Your URL code is #### for all future access, and the report, once generated, will be kept on the server at that URL for X days."
