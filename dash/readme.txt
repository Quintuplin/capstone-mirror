PYTHON LINUX ONLY AUTO-UPDATES (SUDO APT UPDATE) TO 3.5
TO GET 3.7

however, as the process is messy, I'm instead rolling my code back to 3.5
The biggest change is converting f'str' to string.format(str); however if you run into any other errors on completed code, let me know and I can look into it.
