Using ubuntu, support for .nupkg files seems to require installing (sudo apt install)
	mono-complete
and
	nuget

This is the converter we (should) be using, but attribution, EULA, etc will have to be handled, and carefully.

Still figuring out how to run it from R but at least now we have it

It appears to be installed through nuget
	nuget install $filename.nupkg
